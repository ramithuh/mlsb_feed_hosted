AI has helped map proteins.  AI has helped the (astronomical) workload in astronomy.  It‚Äôs doing some things that humans can do, but it‚Äôs also doing things humans can‚Äôt do, because they‚Äôre too tedious.  Science communicators might care about that.

These systems are incredibly useful and power... when tailor made. AlphaFold does 1 job, predicts protein folding. That's all the data it has and understands. It is a scalpel. An LLM is a predictive machine for language. That's all it does.
